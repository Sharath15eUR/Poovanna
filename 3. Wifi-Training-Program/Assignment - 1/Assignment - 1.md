## 1. In which OSL layer the Wi-Fi standard/protocol fits.

The IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi standard operates at **Layer 1 (Physical)** and **Layer 2 (Data Link)** of the OSI model:
- **Layer 1**: Defines radio frequencies (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, etc.), modulation, and signal transmission via radio waves.
- **Layer 2**: Manages MAC addresses, BSSIDs, and frame formatting for device communication.
	- BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) is a unique 48-bit MAC address used to identify a specific access point (AP) or wireless router

## 2. Can you share the Wi-Fi devices that you are using day to day life, share that device's wireless capability/properties after connecting to network. Match your device to corresponding Wi-Fi Generations based on properties

Devices commonly used are: 
 
#### a. LAPTOP
- Protocol: WIFI 6
- STEPS: 
	- `sudo apt install iw` - iw is a tool to manually configure network interface .
	- `iw dev wlp0s20f3 info` - can check for any particular network interface.
	- we can also use `iwconfig <interface_name>`, to check the respective properties.
	- `lshw -C network` - to see details of the network device.

## 3. What is BSS and ESS?

### BSS (Basic Service Set)
- **BSS** is the smallest unit of a Wi-Fi network, consisting of:
	- **One Access Point (AP)**
	- **Multiple Clients (Stations, STAs)**
- Each **BSS** has a unique **BSSID**, which is usually the **MAC address** of the access point.
- **Example**: If you connect your phone to **"Home_WiFi"**, it joins the BSS managed by your router.


### ESS (Extended Service Set)
- An **ESS** is a collection of multiple BSSs that share the same **SSID** to provide **seamless roaming**.
- **Multiple APs** work together.
- Clients can move between them **without reconnecting**.
- APs are linked via a **Distribution System (Ethernet, Mesh, etc.)**
- **Example**: At an **airport**, multiple APs with the same SSID ("Airport_WiFi") allow you to move around **without dropping connection**.


## 4. What are the basic functionalities of Wi-Fi Accesspoint

Some of the basic functionalities of Wi-Fi access points are:

- It supports differrent standards and provides wifi signals to allow wireless devies to connect to the internet
- Via ethernet cable, it connects to a wired network, and can also extend the network coverage without requireing additional cabling
- Broadcast SSID allowing devices to discover and connect to the internet
- Provides protections by
	- Allowing MAC address filtering 
	- Supporting security protocols like WEP, WPA, WPA2 etc
- Helps prioritise network traffic for critical applications like VOIP, video streaming and gaming
- Can create mulitple SSIDs for different user groups and can segment network traffic using VLANs

- **Millimeter Wave (mmW)**: Provides high-capacity links over short distances, often used in 5G networks.
- **Satellite**: Used primarily in remote areas where wired connections are impractical.
- **Wi-Fi Mesh Networks**: Employ multiple access points that connect wirelessly, enhancing coverage and flexibility without requiring extensive cabling.


#### Example of Home/College Wireless Internet Connectivity Backhaul

#### a. Usually in hostels and schools **Wi-Fi mesh network** is the internet connectivity backhaul: 
- **Flexibility**: Easily extendable coverage across campus without significant infrastructure changes.
- **Scalability**: Additional access points can be added as needed to accommodate more users or areas.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reduces the need for extensive cabling, making it a financially viable option for large spaces.
- **Performance**: Capable of supporting high bandwidth demands typical in educational settings.

#### b. At homes, since there is only 1 access point or the router which directly connects to the internet, `Ethernet` is used as the backhaul.



## 10.  List down the Wi-Fi topologies and use cases of each one.

#### a.Infrastructure Mode
- The most common Wi-Fi topology, used in homes, offices, and public networks.
- Components: Includes Wi-Fi clients (laptops, phones) and an Access Point (AP) (e.g., a router).
- Operation: Devices connect to the AP, which manages communication and connects them to the internet or LAN.
- Use case: Home Wi-Fi router providing internet to multiple devices.

#### b. Ad-Hoc Mode (Peer-to-Peer)
- A decentralized network where devices communicate directly without an AP.
- Components: Wi-Fi-enabled devices acting as both clients and routers.
- Operation: Devices form a temporary network for local communication.
- Use case: File sharing between laptops via Wi-Fi Direct.

#### c. Mesh Network
- A decentralized topology where multiple nodes (routers or devices) relay data dynamically.
- Components: Multiple interconnected nodes, where each node acts as a relay.
- Operation: If one node fails, data is rerouted through another, ensuring high reliability.
- Use case: Smart home IoT networks or city-wide public Wi-Fi.

| **Wi-Fi Topology**      | **Description**                                                                                                            | **Use Cases**                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Infrastructure Mode** | Involves a central access point (AP) that connects wireless clients to a network.
